# Understanding Axis Length Scaling in 3D Projection

In a function like `draw_3d_axes`, we want the length of the visualized 3D axes to adapt automatically to the image and template size, without manually tuning values for each case. Here's a breakdown of how we achieve that using the camera intrinsics and template depth.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Step 3: Estimate Average Depth

```python
world_pts = template_corners_3d.reshape(-1, 3)
cam_coords = (R @ world_pts.T + t.reshape(3, 1)).T  # (N,3)
z_mean = np.mean(cam_coords[:, 2])
```

We take the 3D coordinates of the template in world space and transform them into camera space by applying the rotation `R` and translation `t`. This gives us the coordinates of each point from the camera's point of view.

* `cam_coords` contains the camera-space coordinates of each template corner.
* `z_mean` is the average Z value, which corresponds to the average distance from the camera to the template.

This value is important because in perspective projection, apparent size decreases with distance.

#### Step 4: Estimate Focal Length in Pixels

```python
f_pix = (K[0, 0] + K[1, 1]) / 2.0
```

This computes the average focal length in pixels. The intrinsic matrix `K` contains this information:

* `K[0, 0] = fx`: focal length in pixels along the x-axis.
* `K[1, 1] = fy`: focal length in pixels along the y-axis.

We assume `fx ≈ fy`, which is typically true for most cameras (or a reasonable simplification).

#### Step 5: Scale Axis Length Using Pinhole Projection Geometry

```python
axis_length = (diag_pix * axis_scale * z_mean) / f_pix
```

We use the pinhole projection model:

```
image_length = (world_length * focal_length) / depth
```

We rearrange this equation to solve for `world_length` (our desired `axis_length`):

```
world_length = (image_length * depth) / focal_length
```

We define `image_length` as:

```python
image_length = diag_pix * axis_scale
```

where `diag_pix` is the diagonal length of the template in the image, and `axis_scale` is a user-defined proportion.

Putting it all together, this formula lets us specify how big the axis *looks* in the image, and automatically computes the corresponding length in world units.

### Why This Matters

Removing `z_mean` or `f_pix` breaks the physical consistency of the model:

* Without `z_mean`, you ignore the object’s distance, so axes look too small for distant objects.
* Without `f_pix`, your axis size won't adapt properly across cameras with different focal lengths or image resolutions.

This method ensures that axes are:

* Visually proportional to the template's image size.
* Physically correct based on projection geometry.
* Automatically adapted across different templates, camera poses, and image resolutions.
