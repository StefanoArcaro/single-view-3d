## Thesis

### Abstract
Small summary of the thesis:
- Context of the work
- Specific problem approached by the thesis


### Introduction
- Does not correspond to executive summary
- General context description

Follow these 5 questions:
1. What is the problem?
2. Why is it interesting and important?
3. Why is it hard?
4. Why hasn't it been solved before?
5. What are the key components of the approach and results?


### Domain Background
- Technical background needed to understand the problem formulation and solution
- Key concepts and definitions


### Problem Formulation
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Rules of the game
    - Assumptions
    - Constraints


### Related Work
- Alternative approaches / solutions to the same problem
- Originality of the solution
- Limitations of other methods
- How the proposed solution is different


### Proposed Solution
- Always describe algorithms and reference exact lines.
- Implementation details (dedicated section to avoid having the reader lose sight of the conceptual solution)


### Experimental results
- Experiments (datasets, metrics, competing methods: one subsection per experiment)


### Experimental evaluation (?)


### Conclusions
- Key contributions
- Key findings
- Future work
